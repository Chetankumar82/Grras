/*
    Variables are nothing but empty containers used to store specific data within them.

    Rules for declaring a variable:
        1. A variable name should not start with a number
        2. A variable name cannot contain spaces within it's name
        3. A variable name cannot contain any special characters
        4. A variable name cannot be a reserved keyword
        5. JS is case sensitive therefore A and a are both different
        6. JS has variable declaration methods so they should be used while declaring a variable.
*/

// Syntax for variables: <variable-declaration-method> <var-name> = value

// declaration (assign) & initilization
let demo = "Hriday" // initilization
let demo1; // declaration

// console.log(demo)
console.log("The variable demo has", demo)
console.log("The variable demo has "+demo)
console.log(`The variable demo has ${demo}`)
